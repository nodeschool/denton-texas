# NodeSchool Denton
Welcome to beautiful Denton, Texas :-)

Check out our [website for events and news](http://nodeschool.io/denton-texas/). There's also a newsletter, Sign up!!!

We're pretty informal, come join us if you like :-)

### Format

NodeSchool offers self-paced workshoppers that teach node and web programming.  Someone could get a lot out of NodeSchool w/o actually ever joining a chapter.  Chapters offer opportunities for socializing, help, mentoring, community, or co-working.  So anyone visiting your chapter is probably looking to fill one of those needs.

Here's the format we use in Denton, which we stole from Dallas TX.

#### Group Attention (10-30 mins):

1) The News.  Finding the unknown unknowns.  Bring one thing that's new and cool in node.  New Version, new Package, new Tools.  It doesn't need to be new to Node, just new to you.  Ask other people for their news.  

2) The Speaker.  Not always, but sometimes.  Project launches, package authors, language features etc.  I don't recommend "Intro to Node" as that's not new information.  See also "Lightning talks".  Keep expectations at short.
   - Is there anything you'd like a quick talk on?
   - Anyone here want to talk about that?
   - Do you have something to share or demo?


#### Parallel Play (90 mins of anything appropriate to have music in the background):

3) Workshopping.

  - Announce a "Getting Started Table" (or front of room).  This implies consent for mentors to hover.
  - Announce a "Quiet Work Table" (or back of room).  For people who don't want/need hovering.
  - "Buddy up"
    - Ask people to pick a buddy (default someone they are sitting next to).  
    - It's ok to ask your buddy a question.  
    - It's ok to ask your buddy if they want help.  
    - Buddies are an opportunity to pair program a workshop and get a sticker.
  - As a group, do a <5 min demo on how to do a workshop.  Setup do the first lesson in 'javascripting'
  - Ask someone to put on some music

4) Stickers.  
Stickers are too expensive.  Internet please fix that.  We use the stickers as an "Achievement Badge" for completing a full workshop.

### Vision

Our vision is to create a space for community around learning and practicing the craft of Node.js programming.  That space should be "opt-in" and compatible with parallel play.

We abide by the same [Code of Conduct](http://nodeschool.io/dallas/code-of-conduct/) as the Dallas chapter. Please continue to be respectful of the time and efforts of all involved.
